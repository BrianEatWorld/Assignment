Used Pip to install tornado and git
Created folder and git repo for assignment
Because I will only be using the Semantic UI docs, created a submodule in the project for the gh-pages branch of the Semantic UI repo within my repo's folder
Ran through Tornado HelloWorld
Ran into issues with pathing when trying to locate Tornado script outside of content directory
Fixed issue by moving script and then set up hadnlers for the static files. Tornado has a built in static file handler, but use looks like it would require altering the SemanticUI directory structure (put everything in a "static" folder
Revisited the static issue and tried just setting static path to the main "./" directory. Everything works.
Statics declared in the settings seemed to stop working, so I switched back to handling them explicitly
RegEx was causing the majority of the routing problems. Entire site is now functional. FF does not show a favicon, but Tornado isn't returning errors and the favicon is explicitly declared.
Committing and moving on to Selenium, will return to fine tune if needed.
